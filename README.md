# Homework #2

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* for loop - you use this function when you want to do the same task over and over again for a certain number of times.
	* && || ! - These two operators are used when you want to use two conditions to run the same function. Here's an example, if you want to buy food at a restaurant and you want it to have to items such as chicken AND vegetables, you would use the '&&' operator. In another scenario, if you want chicken or steak, you would use the '||' operator to say you'll have an item from the menu that has one or the other.
	* Array - This can be thought of like an object with multiple values. If my hobbies were an array, they would like like this var myHobbies = ['basketball', 'running', 'cycling']
	* git - this is the version control system, meaning you can save and upload new versions of your code using this program. 
	* GitHub - this is like Google Drive but for coding. You can save different versions of your code on GitHub and work with people around the world on the same project. They can see your changes and you can see theirs in each version.
